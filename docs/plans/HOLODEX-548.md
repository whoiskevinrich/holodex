# HOLODEX-548 · Only uploaded images keep an orphan from the sweep

Done when the orphan sweep counts only `source = 'upload'` person and studio images as authored
data. Owner decision 2026-10-08: a provider-downloaded image is restorable by enriching again, and
counting it kept every cast member created by video enrichment forever.

**Design package:** [person-media-linking.md P0-9](../specs/person-media-linking.md) · [studio-entity.md RD1](../specs/studio-entity.md)   <!-- links; source of truth for *what*; this file is source of truth for *where it stands* -->

## Gates — definition of done

<!-- These rows are GENERATED at scaffold time from flightplan.yaml `gates:`, filtered to the
     `postures:` default; an empty roster leaves no rows at all, and status then comes from the
     release note alone. The rows below are only the unscaffolded template's. Once `profile:` is set,
     match them to that posture, adding rows as well as removing them. States: [ ] not started · [/] in progress · [~] deliberately
     skipped · [x] done. [~] and [x] both count as SETTLED — an epic can reach a full count with a
     documented skip (ADR-004). PostToolUse(Skill) flips a gate to [/] when its skill runs; ONLY
     /handoff writes [~] or [x]. -->

- [x] spec `write-spec` → `docs/specs/**` — person-media-linking P0-9, studio-entity RD1
- [x] backend → `{cmd,internal,providers}/**` — `orphanAuthoredSQL` image predicates
- [x] testing `testing-strategy` — `TestOrphanSweep_OnlyOwnerImagesProtect`, testing-strategy.md §F40

<!-- Deliberate-skip example — always say why; `until:` records what would reopen the concern later
     (as a fresh up-next item or its own issue — the gate itself stays settled):
- [~] security `security-review` — until: a mutation endpoint exists (read-only slice so far) -->

## Up next — ordered (position = priority)

<!-- Numbered queue. Position is the priority — no P1/P2 tags. Each item: [gate] one-liner — file path.
     ⛔ marks blocked (say on what). → KEY promotes a separable item to its own issue.
     The top item is surfaced in the SessionStart banner, clipped if long (the trailing path
     survives; the middle is dropped) — so keep it to one line.
     The CHECKBOX settles an item and nothing else does: [x] done, [~] dropped, same states as a gate
     row. A strikethrough is emphasis, not a state — `~~half~~ now do the rest` is a live item
     (ADR-008). This queue holds LIVE work only: delete a done item, move a dropped one to
     ## Dropped at the end of this file (ADR-010). The banner counts any settled item left here. -->


## Session log — append-only (cap: last 8 sessions; older → archive/)

<!-- One entry per session, newest at the top. PostToolUse(Skill) creates the entry + appends the
     `- skills:` line mechanically; /handoff writes the `- handoff:` sentence the next SessionStart
     banner echoes. Shape:
### 2026-07-10 · what happened this session
- skills: write-spec, architecture
- handoff: the sentence the next session should wake up to
-->

### 2026-10-08 · owner chose uploads-only; spec edited
- skills: handoff, implement, code-review
- handoff: Built and green; review widened "uploaded" to any non-enrichment source (promoted headshots are owner-chosen) plus rejections and halos. PR #466 ready; nothing left but merge.

## Dropped — newest first (the reason is the point)

<!-- Up-next items decided AGAINST, moved here by /handoff when dropped (ADR-010). Done items are
     deleted instead — git and the session log already record them; a dropped item has no other
     record, so its reason lives here. Shape:
- [~] [testing] <thing you decided not to do> — dropped 2026-07-29, <why>
-->
