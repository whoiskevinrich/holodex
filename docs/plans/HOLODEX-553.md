# HOLODEX-553 · A studio rename reaches the video files

The studio version of HOLODEX-551. Done when renaming a studio rewrites the Studio tag on every
linked video, as studio merge already does. Stacked on the HOLODEX-551 branch (PR #473), because it
reuses `writequeue.SourceRename` and the rename-propagation shape.

**Design package:** [metadata-extraction.md F48.8g](../specs/metadata-extraction.md)   <!-- links; source of truth for *what*; this file is source of truth for *where it stands* -->

## Gates — definition of done

<!-- These rows are GENERATED at scaffold time from flightplan.yaml `gates:`, filtered to the
     `postures:` default; an empty roster leaves no rows at all, and status then comes from the
     release note alone. The rows below are only the unscaffolded template's. Once `profile:` is set,
     match them to that posture, adding rows as well as removing them. States: [ ] not started · [/] in progress · [~] deliberately
     skipped · [x] done. [~] and [x] both count as SETTLED — an epic can reach a full count with a
     documented skip (ADR-004). PostToolUse(Skill) flips a gate to [/] when its skill runs; ONLY
     /handoff writes [~] or [x]. -->

- [x] spec `write-spec` → `docs/specs/**` — metadata-extraction F48.8g
- [x] backend → `{cmd,internal,providers}/**` — `propagateStudioRename`, `repo.VideoIDsForStudio`
- [x] testing `testing-strategy` — `TestStudioRenameEndpoint_PropagatesWritebackToLinkedVideos`, testing-strategy.md §F48.8f

<!-- Deliberate-skip example — always say why; `until:` records what would reopen the concern later
     (as a fresh up-next item or its own issue — the gate itself stays settled):
- [~] security `security-review` — until: a mutation endpoint exists (read-only slice so far) -->

## Up next — ordered (position = priority)

<!-- Numbered queue. Position is the priority — no P1/P2 tags. Each item: [gate] one-liner — file path.
     ⛔ marks blocked (say on what). → KEY promotes a separable item to its own issue.
     The top item is surfaced in the SessionStart banner, clipped if long (the trailing path
     survives; the middle is dropped) — so keep it to one line.
     The CHECKBOX settles an item and nothing else does: [x] done, [~] dropped, same states as a gate
     row. A strikethrough is emphasis, not a state — `~~half~~ now do the rest` is a live item
     (ADR-008). This queue holds LIVE work only: delete a done item, move a dropped one to
     ## Dropped at the end of this file (ADR-010). The banner counts any settled item left here. -->

1. [ ] [—] Merge main in once #473 squash-merges, so this PR's diff is studio-only — `git merge origin/main`

## Session log — append-only (cap: last 8 sessions; older → archive/)

<!-- One entry per session, newest at the top. PostToolUse(Skill) creates the entry + appends the
     `- skills:` line mechanically; /handoff writes the `- handoff:` sentence the next SessionStart
     banner echoes. Shape:
### 2026-10-09 · what happened this session
- skills: write-spec, architecture
- handoff: the sentence the next session should wake up to
-->

### 2026-10-09 · studio rename propagates writeback
- skills: code-review, handoff, implement
- handoff: Fixed and green (go test ./...). It's stacked on #473, so merge that first, then merge main in here before this PR merges.

## Dropped — newest first (the reason is the point)

<!-- Up-next items decided AGAINST, moved here by /handoff when dropped (ADR-010). Done items are
     deleted instead — git and the session log already record them; a dropped item has no other
     record, so its reason lives here. Shape:
- [~] [testing] <thing you decided not to do> — dropped 2026-07-29, <why>
-->
