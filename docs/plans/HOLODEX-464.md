# HOLODEX-464 · MP4 genre writeback keeps only the last tag

Done means every writeback backend stores a multi-value field (genres, actors) as one comma-delimited
string, so an MP4 written with three tags reads back three, and a rescan can't drop file-sourced tags.

**Design package:** bug fix, no spec/ADR/design · [testing-strategy § Multi-value genre writeback round trip](../testing-strategy.md)

## Gates — definition of done

<!-- These rows are GENERATED at scaffold time from flightplan.yaml `gates:`, filtered to the
     `postures:` default — the list below is only what you get with no config. Once `profile:` is
     set, trim them to that posture. States: [ ] not started · [/] in progress · [~] deliberately
     skipped · [x] done. [~] and [x] both count as SETTLED — an epic can reach a full count with a
     documented skip (ADR-004). PostToolUse(Skill) flips a gate to [/] when its skill runs; ONLY
     /handoff writes [~] or [x]. -->

- [~] spec `write-spec` → `docs/specs/**` — bug fix restoring intended behavior; no requirement changed
- [x] backend → `{cmd,internal,providers}/**`
- [x] testing `testing-strategy`

<!-- Deliberate-skip example — always say why; `until:` records what would reopen the concern later
     (as a fresh up-next item or its own issue — the gate itself stays settled):
- [~] security `security-review` — until: a mutation endpoint exists (read-only slice so far) -->

## Up next — ordered (position = priority)

<!-- Numbered queue. Position is the priority — no P1/P2 tags. Each item: [gate] one-liner — file path.
     ⛔ marks blocked (say on what). → KEY promotes a separable item to its own issue.
     The top item is surfaced in the SessionStart banner, clipped if long (the trailing path
     survives; the middle is dropped) — so keep it to one line.
     The CHECKBOX settles an item and nothing else does: [x] done, [~] dropped, same states as a gate
     row. A strikethrough is emphasis, not a state — `~~half~~ now do the rest` is a live item
     (ADR-008). This queue holds LIVE work only: delete a done item, move a dropped one to
     ## Dropped at the end of this file (ADR-010). The banner counts any settled item left here. -->

1. [ ] [—] Open the PR, mark ready once CI is green, squash-merge on Kevin's ping — `internal/writeback/writeback.go`
2. [ ] [—] After release: re-run tag writeback sync to repair MP4s written with only their last tag — `internal/api/tag_writeback_sync.go`  ⛔ blocked on #1
3. [ ] [—] Keywords/Category re-import and tagline→tag leak → HOLODEX-465, HOLODEX-466

## Session log — append-only (cap: last 8 sessions; older → archive/)

<!-- One entry per session, newest at the top. PostToolUse(Skill) creates the entry + appends the
     `- skills:` line mechanically; /handoff writes the `- handoff:` sentence the next SessionStart
     banner echoes. Shape:
### 2026-07-10 · what happened this session
- skills: write-spec, architecture
- handoff: the sentence the next session should wake up to
-->

### 2026-09-26 · session
- skills: product-brainstorming, code-review, handoff
- handoff: Fix committed and all gates settled — `fileValue` joins multi-value fields with ", " on all three writers, TestGenreRoundTrip_MultiValue (-tags integration) fails on MP4 without it; next move is to open the PR and merge.

## Dropped — newest first (the reason is the point)

<!-- Up-next items decided AGAINST, moved here by /handoff when dropped (ADR-010). Done items are
     deleted instead — git and the session log already record them; a dropped item has no other
     record, so its reason lives here. Shape:
- [~] [testing] <thing you decided not to do> — dropped 2026-07-29, <why>
-->
